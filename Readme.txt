Operation Eigenfaust 3D Tech Demo for MATLAB v0.85

This is the first 3D game (demo) ever made with 'pure' MATLAB available on MATLAB Central. 
In this demo, you can freely roam in a quasi environment. The game runs at 40~60 FPS on my three year old Lenovo G460.

The sole purpose of this demo is to show off the discrete ray-casting engine I have written, which is an implementation of the algorithm on this page:
http://www.permadi.com/tutorial/raycast/

Right now the engine is almost fully functional. It renders half-opened doors and objects behind them properly. You can interact with the doors by pressing space while standing in front of them. There is also perfect collision detection.

There is a switch hidden somewhere in this level, but you won't be able to interact with it...

How to play:
-----------------
WASD 	- move //
Left/Right arrow - rotate //
Enter	- mouse on/off //
ESC 	- quit demo//
Move mouse	- mouselook (when mouse is on) //
mouse wheel	- zoom in/out
--------------------

Enjoy!
