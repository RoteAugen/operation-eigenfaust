##### A MATLAB 3D First Person Shooter

This is the first 3D game (demo) ever made with 'pure' MATLAB available on MATLAB Central.
In this demo, you can freely roam in a quasi-3D environment. The game runs at 40~60 FPS on my three year old Lenovo G460.

The sole purpose of this demo is to show off the discrete ray-casting engine I have written, which is an implementation of the ray casting algorithm on this page: 
http://www.permadi.com/tutorial/raycast/

Right now the engine is almost fully functional. It even renders half-opened doors and objects behind them properly. You can interact with the doors by pressing space while standing in front of them. There is also perfect collision detection.

There is a switch hidden somewhere in this level, but you won't be able to interact with it...
###Install
Run opeig.m or install it as a MATLAB app.

###How to play
WASD - move // 
Left/Right arrow - rotate // 
Enter	- mouse on/off // 
ESC - quit demo// 
Move mouse	- mouselook (when mouse is on) // 
mouse wheel	- zoom in/out 


Enjoy!
